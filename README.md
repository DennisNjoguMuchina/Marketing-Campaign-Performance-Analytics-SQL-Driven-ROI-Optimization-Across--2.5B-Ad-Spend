# Marketing Campaign Performance Analytics SQL Project

## Introduction

As a data analyst passionate about driving marketing success through actionable insights, I developed this comprehensive SQL project to analyze multi-million dollar marketing campaign performance across multiple channels and customer segments. This project demonstrates my ability to transform complex marketing data into strategic business recommendations that directly impact ROI and customer acquisition strategies.

**Target Audience**: Marketing Directors, Campaign Managers, Growth Strategists, and Sales/Marketing Recruiters looking for analytical talent who understands both data and business strategy.

## Background

In today's competitive marketing landscape, organizations spend billions on campaigns across multiple channels without clear visibility into what's actually driving results. This project tackles a real-world scenario where a company invested **$2.5+ billion** across 5 campaign types, 6 marketing channels, and 5 customer segments.

**The Challenge**: With massive spend across Email, Display, Influencer, Search, and Social Media campaigns, the marketing team needed data-driven insights to:
- Identify which channels deliver the best ROI
- Understand customer acquisition costs by channel
- Optimize budget allocation for maximum impact
- Discover high-value customer segments worth targeting
- Make strategic decisions about campaign duration and geographic focus

**The Business Impact**: Poor marketing attribution costs companies 20-30% of their marketing budget annually. This analysis provides the foundation for data-driven decisions that can save millions and dramatically improve campaign effectiveness.

## Tools I Used

For this marketing analytics project, I leveraged several key tools to extract maximum insights from the campaign data:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis for data extraction, transformation, and complex analytical queries
  - Complex JOIN operations across multiple campaign datasets
  - Window functions for ranking and comparative analysis
  - Aggregation functions for calculating KPIs like ROI, conversion rates, and engagement scores
  - CTEs and subqueries for multi-layered analysis

- **Excel Power Query**: Essential for data cleaning and preprocessing before analysis
  - Automated data transformation and standardization across multiple data sources
  - Data type conversions and null value handling for consistent analysis
  - Column mapping and data validation to ensure data quality
  - Merged disparate campaign data sources into unified datasets

- **Database Management**: Structured and optimized large datasets containing billions in marketing spend and impressions

- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied marketing analytics methodologies to calculate:
  - Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)
  - Return on Investment (ROI) 
  - Conversion rates by channel and segment
  - Click-through rates (CTR)
  - Engagement scoring algorithms
